I am a computational scientist from Bangladesh. I will be joining as a postdoctoral fellow in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.k-state.edu/) at K-State. I completed my PhD from the same department in May 2021. My supervisor was [Dr. Caterina Scoglio](http://www.ece.k-state.edu//people/faculty/scoglio/index.html). I work with predictive models of infectious diseases. My areas of expertise include network theory, disease outbreak simulations, and sequence prediction models using recurrent neural networks.

Prior to my PhD program, I worked at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh (SRBD)](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) as a software engineer for 3.5 years. I have designed and developed IoT applications, NAT traversal solutions, and networking applications in general. I have experience in software quality assurance (QA) where I developed tools for unit, integration, and compliance testing of computer networking applications. I have also managed a team of software developers.
