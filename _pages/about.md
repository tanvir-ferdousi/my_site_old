Welcome to my website. I am a researcher in computer science. I work as a [postdoctoral research associate](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/tanvir-ferdousi) at the UVA Biocomplexity Institute. I completed my PhD in electrical and computer engineering from Kansas State University, supervised by [Dr. Caterina Scoglio](http://www.ece.k-state.edu//people/faculty/scoglio/index.html). My areas of expertise include network science, infectious outbreak models, blockchains, and machine learning.

In the past, I worked at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) as a software engineer for 3.5 years. I have designed, developed, tested applications related to the internet of things and network connectivity.
