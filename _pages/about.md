Hello and welcome to my website. I am a researcher in computer science, currently working as a postdoctoral [research associate](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/tanvir-ferdousi) at the UVA Biocomplexity Institute.

I am working with the [CINES](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/project/cines-cyberinfrastructure-network-engineering-and-science) team to develop a network science and engineering cyber-infrastructure. The web interface is open and available at [net.science](https://net.science/). I am also working with the [AgAID](https://agaid.org/) institute, where my focus is to address problems related to water availability modeling using AI.

I completed my Ph.D. from Kansas State University in 2021, where [Dr. Caterina Scoglio](http://www.ece.k-state.edu//people/faculty/scoglio/index.html) supervised me. My areas of expertise include network science, infectious outbreak models, blockchains, and machine learning. Before that, I worked as a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) for 3.5 years. I have designed, developed, tested applications related to the internet of things and network connectivity.
